# Student-Information-Form-with-MongoDB
This project is a Student Information Form with MongoDB as the database to store submitted data. It features a simple HTML form where students enter their Registration Number, Name, Email, and Branch. Upon submission, the data is sent to the server via a POST request, and the server processes and saves this information in a MongoDB database.
